    \qmltype NotificationInterface
    \inqmlmodule service
    \inherits Notification
    \since 5.11
    \brief An interface for requesting notifications.

    NotificationInterface inherits \l {Notification} from \l{Qt Application Manager}
    and acts like an adapter for Neptune 3 UI.
    The NotificationInterface properties \c timeout and \c category are adopted
    to match Neptune 3 UI requirements and should not be used. In the Neptune 3 UI
    interaction, notifications should always be dismissed by an end user
    instead of a time-out.

    \section2 Example Usage

    The following example demonstrates the NotificationInterface usage:

    \qml

    NotificationInterface {
        summary: "Notification Prio 9"
        body: "Notification sample"
        priority: 9
        icon: Style.imageM("maps")
    }
    \endqml

    \c summary defines a notification title. \c body defines a notification
    description. Notifications are queued based on a value in \c priority.
    \c icon must contain an absolute icon path. Otherwise, the icon is not shown.
*/

Notification {
    id: root

    timeout: 0
    category: "notification"
}
