    \brief A window used from applications to display modal popups in sysui.

    The popup window of a Neptune 3 application is displayed on the Center Console. This
    component gives the application the flexibility to create a popup containing any kind
    of custom content and display it in system ui as a system modal popup.

    \section2 Example Usage

    \qml
    //DevicesListPopup.qml

    PopupWindow {
        id: root

        property var deviceModel

        Item {
            id: popupContent
            anchors.fill: parent

            Label {
                id: headerText
                text: "Please choose device"
            }

            ListView {
                id: deviceList
                model: root.deviceModel
                delegate: RadioButton {
                    .....
                }
                .....
            }
        }
    }


    //DevicesMenu.qml

    Item {
        id: root

        Button {
            id: button
            text: "Choose Device"
            onClicked: {
                var pos = button.mapToItem(root, button.width/2, button.height/2);
                devicesListPopup.originItemX = pos.x;
                devicesListPopup.originItemY = pos.y;
                deviceListPopup.visible = true;
            }
        }
        ......
        DevicesListPopup {
            width: 910
            height: 500
            id: devicesListPopup
        }
    }

    \endqml

    The application's custom popup component should inherit from PopupWindow.
    That said, the custom popup should then be instantiated inside the file which
    will use it and the element responsible of opening it should set its originItemX,
    originItemY, width and height and then request to show it by setting the
    visible property to true as shown in the example.
