Squish tests for Neptune 3
--------------------------

Squish is a commercial automated GUI testing tool from froglogic (https://www.froglogic.com/squish-gui-testing/).

It should provide a basic set of scripts for Neptune, QML Live, QtAMP for smoke testing on a CI.
Further it documents and provides reference scripts as part of Neptune 3 and enable Qt Auto developers who deal with any UI to write own tests if needed.

Squish is not included in the Qt Auto package, customers have to talk to Froglogic to get it.
There is no ambition to achieve a full test coverage in Neptune 3, some tools (QML Live, QtAMP) should reach full test coverage.
