    \qmltype ApplicationRequestHandler
    \inqmlmodule requests
    \inherits QtObject
    \since 5.11
    \brief An object used to perform actions.

    The ApplicationRequestHandler is not meant to be used as is in the system, instead it is
    acting as the receiver of the requests coming from the applications using the
    Qt.openUrlExternally function as shown in the example below.

    \section2 Example Usage

    \qml

    Button {
        id: openTunerApp
        onClicked: {
            Qt.openUrlExternally("x-tuner://");
        }
    }

    Button {
        id: openPhoneAppBluetoothMenu
        onClicked: {
            Qt.openUrlExternally("x-phone://settings/bluetooth");
        }
    }

    \endqml

    The interface to act on application requests. A request is used to instruct an
    application to just open or open in a certain state. That said, the action should
    be possible to be performed from wherever in the system. An application could call
    the Qt.openUrlExternally() function passing as parameter the mime-type of the
    application that is intended to be opened, followed by the desired url indicating what
    the application should do when opening. For this to be successful, the respective mime-Types
    should be added accordingly to the applications' info.yaml files (example: mimeTypes:
    [ 'x-scheme-handler/x-tuner' ]) The ApplicationManager will then consult its internal
    database of applications looking for a match with x-scheme-handler/x-mimeType. If there
    is a successful match, then the openUrlRequested signal will be emitted and its receiver
    (ApplicationRequestHandler) can then either acknowledge the request by calling
    acknowledgeOpenUrlRequest function or reject (rejectOpenUrlRequest). If then the application
    is started, the url is supplied to the application as a document through the signal
    openDocument(string documentUrl, string mimeType) via its ApplicationInterface.
