There are two ways to run qml tests:

1-Execute the automated tests defined inside TestCase{} throughout tst_*.qml files
  (using a qmltestrunner):
    build_dir$ make check

2-Try out a test in a window for manual interaction (manual testing).
    Say you have a component called WidgetDrawer. If it has a test it will
    be called tst_WidgetDrawer.qml. To show it using triton-qmlscene you run:

    build_dir/tests/qmltests$ make tryWidgetDrawer
