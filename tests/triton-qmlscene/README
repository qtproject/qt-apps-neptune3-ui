triton-qmlscene is useful when you want to manually interact with a qml file that has a TestCase in it.

It's just qmlscene from qtdeclarative with minor modifications. Namely:
  - Made it register a dummy QTestRootObject singleton type under a Qt.test.qtestroot so that qml files
    that have a TestCase (ie, that import QtTest) can be loaded and displayed.
  - Added a MouseTouchAdaptor for emulating touch interaction with a mouse device
