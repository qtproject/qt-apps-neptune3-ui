1. What is Appman Squish Hook plugin?
================================

It is a plugin for the Qt Application Manager (appman) and
applications using the appman qml runtime. It simplifies usage of
Squish with applications managed by appman.
The Qt Application Manager keeps the sub-applications under tight
control, which makes hooking it with Squish difficult. The Squish Hook
Plugin turns the applicatons using appman runtime into attachable
applications, using the TCP port specified in the appliation mainfest
file.

2. Usage
================================

Once the Appman Squish Plugin is installed, it can be used by passing
the path to the squish-appman-hook.yaml configuration file:

appman [...] -c squish-appman-hook.yaml

Alternatively, the contents of the file can be manually merged with
the main configuration file.
The TCP port for each of the tested applications must be specified in
the application manifest file by adding a squishPort parameter:

applicationProperties: { private: { squishPort: 45678 } }

The application needs to be registered with the squishserver under the
specified port. Once the application is started using base appman GUI,
it can be attached to with the attachToApplication() Squish test API.
