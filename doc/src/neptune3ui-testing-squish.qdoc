   \title Neptune 3 UI - Squish Automated UI testing
   \brief How to use Squish within Neptune 3 UI

    \l{Squish} is a commercial product from \l{Froglogic}
    which is used for automated GUI testing.

    The goals of tests and their setup are:
    \list
     \li Provide a basic set of scripts for \l{Neptune 3 UI}, \l{Qt QmlLive}, and
         \l{Qt Application Manager} for \e{smoke testing} on a CI.
     \li Document any specifics in \l{Qt Automotive Suite}, especially the multi-processing
         aspect of it, a user should pay attention to when it comes to automated
         UI testing with Squish.
     \li Provide reference scripts as a part of Neptune 3 UI.
     \li Enable developers working with UI, in the \l{Qt Automotive Suite}, to
         write their own tests if needed.
    \endlist



    The basic prerequisite to use the tests provided are:
    \list
     \li \l{Qt Automotive Suite}
     \li Squish installed on the test machine
    \endlist

    \note Squish and the accompanying license must be obtained from \l{Froglogic}.


    \section1 Set Up Your Test Environment

    Squish can be either run within an IDE or
    as a service. The IDE is available on most developers' platforms, the service program
    called \c squishserver is either distributed with the IDE or it can be adapted
    from an embedded source package, which can run on
    different platforms and is also provided as download from \l{Froglogic}.

    The \e{target} referenced embedded system is a \l{Yocto} Linux x64 build
    which can be installed within the Qt Automotive Suite as "Intel NUC".

    Tests are provided in \c squishtest sub folder in Neptune 3 UI and can be imported
    as suite directly into Squish IDE.


    \section2 Application(s) Under Test (AUTs)
    Whether you use the Squish IDE or \e squishserver, you must define all
    of the AUTs, which also includes all sub processes that are called from
    within the Neptune3 UI application. For multi-process each of the Neptune3
    apps (see \l{Neptune 3 UI - Application Development}) run as a
    \e{appman-launcher-qml} process (\l{Qt Application Manager}). To distinguish
    and attach to these processes you need to use the \e{Squish hook plugin}
    that extends Squish's attachable AUT feature. The \c server.ini file has
    to be adapted to point to where the Neptune3 UI and other AUTs are located.
    Because in multi-process all Neptune3 apps must be connected via the attachable
    AUT feature of Squish,
    they must be defined as attachable AUTs with a corresponding port number.

    For each Neptune3 app (as attachable AUT) the port in the \c server.ini has
    to match the port defined in its \c{info.yaml} manifest file as \e{squishPort} property
    (the Neptune3 apps and their manifest files are located in \c {neptune3/apps}).

    To run the tests directly from the IDE it is possible and
    recommended to change and add AUTs and attachable AUTs with port number from
    inside the IDE.

    For more details, see \l{https://doc.froglogic.com/squish/latest/rg-ini-files.html}{Squish
    Initialization Files}.

    \badcode
[General]
AUT/NeptuneControlApp = "/home/user/install/neptune3"
AUT/RemoteSettingsServer = "/home/user/install/neptune3"
AUT/appman = "/home/user/qt/bin"
AUT/appman-launcher-qml = "/home/user/qt/bin"
AUT/neptune3-ui = "/home/user/install/neptune3"
ApplicationPaths = "/home/user/qt/bin,"
attachableAUT/RemoteSettingsServer = "localhost:5985"
attachableAUT/neptune3-ui = "localhost:3334"
attachableAUT/appman = "localhost:7777"
attachableAUT/app_appstore = "localhost:7720"
attachableAUT/app_calendar = "localhost:7721"
attachableAUT/app_climate = "localhost:7722"
attachableAUT/app_cluster = "localhost:7723"
attachableAUT/app_downloads = "localhost:7724"
attachableAUT/app_hud = "localhost:7725"
attachableAUT/app_map = "localhost:7726"
attachableAUT/app_music = "localhost:7727"
attachableAUT/app_phone = "localhost:7728"
attachableAUT/app_settings = "localhost:7729"
attachableAUT/app_sheets = "localhost:7730"
attachableAUT/app_tuner = "localhost:7731"
attachableAUT/app_vehicle = "localhost:7732"
    \endcode


    \note Different Qt versions

    If the Qt version for Squish release differs from the Qt version
    used in Neptune3 UI (currently 5.12), when the tests start, you may notice a warning
    in the logs from \c squishserver indicating that: \br
     "\c{Loaded Qt version 5.xx differs from Squish/Qt expected version 5.yy,
    automating this AUT may not work.}"\br
    In this case, you need to copy the following Qt libraries from your
    installation folder to Squish's installation library folder:
    \e{libQt5Widgets.so}, \e{libQt5QuickWidgets.so}

    \section2 D-BUS
    Neptune 3 UI needs a D-Bus session, on Linux this can be achieved by running
    \badcode
export $(dbus-launch)
    \endcode
    before starting the IDE. In case of a target installation this should already be
    included during the boot process.

    \section1 Squish from Command Line or on Target

    After setting up the test environment there is the option to run tests via IDE,
    command line, or as a service such as a \c systemd service (recommended)
    for the target \l{Yocto} environment.
    Remember to use a D-Bus session beforehand, this is how Neptune 3 UI communicates
    with its sub processes.

    For simple cases, normally, you can use a server, \c squishserver, to run the
    tests and a client, \c squishrunner, that can request the server to run these
    test cases and return their results.

    The AUT is on the server side, the test cases are transmitted from \c squishrunner
    to \c squishserver, they need not be stored on the testing machine.
    In the IDE case when performing tests, both (\c squishserver and
    \c squishrunner) are executed seamlessly on the same machine.

    When you use the the command line, start the server first before the clients.

    Ensure that all IP addresses for \c squishrunner are able to connect to
    \c squishserver. On the \c squishserver, this is stored in
    \c $SQUISH_DIR/etc/squishserverrc. Make sure that the IP ranges match,
    \e{localhost} is always valid.

    The server starts with (\c squishserver also has a default port)
    \badcode
$SQUISH_DIR/bin/squishserver --port 3333
    \endcode

    Change directory to the \c squishtest path in your Neptune 3 UI installation,
    and run a single test case by
    \badcode
$SQUISH_DIR/bin/squishrunner --host SQUISH_SERVER_IP --port 3333 --testsuite suite_neptune3 --testcase tst_popup_climate
    \endcode
    The test cases / suites on a client are executed and the results returned.


    \section1 Squish on Target (Yocto) Environment

    You can add a test environment on target hardware with Neptune 3 UI installed.
    As mentioned before, for a Yocto environment a custom \c squishserver needs to be created using
    the Yocto SDK, and a squish-embedded source package can also be downloaded
    from \l{Froglogic} website. A binary desktop Squish
    installation is also needed to use the \c squishidl command yet.

    \section2 Creating a Custom (Yocto) Squishserver

    The Yocto environment is a x64 Linux but unlike a standard ubuntu x64 version,
    libraries in Yocto are stored in \c /lib64 versus \c /lib .

    Download and install Yocto SDK separately or use it from your Qt Automotive Suite installation
    (Qt Automotive Suite, Intel NUC).
    Then download squish-embedded source package \c squish-x.x.x-qt-embedded-src.tar.gz from
    the \l{Froglogic} website.

    To enable cross compiling do
    \badcode
source <SDK-install-location>/environment-setup-corei7-64-poky-linux
    \endcode
    and then change directory to where the squish-embedded source package is (\c SQUISH_DIR is where the
    installation of the binary desktop edition is stored):
    \badcode
mkdir -p yocto/build && cd yocto/build
    \endcode
    then run
    \badcode
../../configure --with-qmake=<SDK-install-location>/sysroots/x86_64-pokysdk-linux/usr/bin/qmake --enable-qmake-config --with-squishidl=$SQUISH_DIR/bin/squishidl --disable-all --enable-qt --enable-server
    \endcode
    followed by
    \badcode
./build
    \endcode
    create a destination dir
    \badcode
mkdir ../install
    \endcode
    build install into it, and create an archive to be better transferable and storable (use same version as squish)
    \badcode
./build install DESTDIR=../install && tar cfz ../squish-x.x.x-qt-yocto.tgz ../install
    \endcode


    \section2 Install and Set Up Custom Yocto Squishserver on Target Hardware

    The affected directory structure on the Neptune 3 target is
    \badcode
./home/root
./home/.squish
./opt
./opt/squish
    \endcode
    \list
      \li \c squish.x.x.x-qt.yocto.tgz should be unpacked into \c /opt/squish-for-qt-x.x.x
          Adapt version, this is \c $SQUISH_DIR .
      \li edit \c $SQUISH_DIR/etc/squishserverrc to match your network arrangements.
      \li put your license key into \c /home/root
      \li transfer the \c $USER\.squish configuration files from your working, such as created from the IDE, and adapt the
          paths to Neptune 3 UI installation (\c /opt/ ).
          Files covered are: \c server.ini and \c paths.ini in sub folder \c .squish/ver1/ , also look again at
          \l{https://doc.froglogic.com/squish/latest/rg-ini-files.html}{Squish initialization files}.
    \endlist
    \note Tests cannot be performed while Neptune 3 UI is running. You need to make
    sure that the \c neptune3-ui process is terminated, prior to running the tests.

    Also note that before you start \c squishserver you
    need to get a D-Bus session by running either
    \badcode
export $(dbus-launch)
    \endcode
    on the console, or for an automatic start-up to use a D-Bus enabled
    \c systemd \c squishserver service.
