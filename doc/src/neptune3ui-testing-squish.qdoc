   \title Neptune 3 UI - Squish Automated UI testing
   \brief How to use Squish within Neptune 3 UI.

    \l{Squish} is a commercial product from \l{Froglogic} which is used for automated GUI testing.

    The goals of these tests and their setup are so that we can:

    \list
     \li Provide a basic set of scripts for \l{Neptune 3 UI}, \l{Qt QmlLive}, and
         \l{Qt Application Manager} for smoke testing on a CI.
     \li Document any specifics in Qt Automotive Suite, especially the multi-processing aspect,
         which users should pay attention to for automated UI testing with Squish.
     \li Provide reference scripts as a part of Neptune 3 UI.
     \li Enable developers working with UI, in the Qt Automotive Suite, to write their own
         tests, if needed.
    \endlist

    To use these tests, you need:
    \list
     \li \l{Qt Automotive Suite}
     \li Squish installed on the test machine
    \endlist

    \note Squish and the accompanying license must be obtained from \l{Froglogic}.


    \section1 Set Up Your Test Environment

    Squish can be run:

    \list 1
        \li within an IDE - the Squish IDE is available for most developer platforms.
        \li as a service - the service program, \c squishserver, is either distributed
            with the IDE or can be adapted from an embedded source package. This source package
            runs on different platforms and is downloadable from \l{Froglogic}.
    \endlist

    The \e{target} referenced embedded system is a \l{Yocto} Linux x64 build which, on the
    Qt Automotive Suite, can be installed as \b{Intel NUC}.

    Tests are provided in Neptune 3 UI's \c squishtest sub folder, and can be imported as a suite
    directly into the Squish IDE.


    \section2 Application(s) Under Test (AUTs)

    Whether you use the Squish IDE or \e squishserver, you must define all of the AUTs, that also
    includes all sub-processes that are called from within Neptune 3 UI apps. For multi-process,
    each of the \l{Neptune 3 UI - App Development}{Neptune 3 UI apps} run as
    \c{appman-launcher-qml} processes.

    To distinguish and attach to these processes you need to use the \b{Squish hook plugin} that
    extends Squish's attachable AUT feature. The \c server.ini file must be adapted to specify
    where Neptune 3 UI and the other AUTs are located.

    Because in multi-process, all Neptune 3 UI apps must be connected via Squish's attachable AUT
    feature, these apps must be defined as attachable AUTs with a corresponding port number.
    Additionally, the port in the \c server.ini has to match the port defined in its \c{info.yaml}
    manifest file as \c{squishPort} property.

    \note The Neptune 3 UI apps and their manifest files are located in \c {neptune3/apps}).

    To run these tests directly from the IDE, it is possible and recommended to add or modify AUTs
    and attachable AUTs with port numbers, in the IDE itself.

    For more details, see \l{https://doc.froglogic.com/squish/latest/rg-ini-files.html}{Squish
    Initialization Files}.

    \badcode
[General]
AUT/appman = "/home/user/qt/bin"
AUT/appman-launcher-qml = "/home/user/qt/bin"
AUT/neptune3-ui = "/home/user/install/neptune3"
attachableAUT/neptune3-ui = "localhost:3334"
attachableAUT/appman = "localhost:7777"
attachableAUT/app_appstore = "localhost:7720"
attachableAUT/app_calendar = "localhost:7721"
attachableAUT/app_climate = "localhost:7722"
attachableAUT/app_cluster = "localhost:7723"
attachableAUT/app_downloads = "localhost:7724"
attachableAUT/app_hud = "localhost:7725"
attachableAUT/app_map = "localhost:7726"
attachableAUT/app_music = "localhost:7727"
attachableAUT/app_phone = "localhost:7728"
attachableAUT/app_settings = "localhost:7729"
attachableAUT/app_sheets = "localhost:7730"
attachableAUT/app_tuner = "localhost:7731"
attachableAUT/app_vehicle = "localhost:7732"
    \endcode

    \section2 Exclude Disruptive Sub-Processes

    Typically, Squish tries to connect to all sub-processes that are created from an initial AUT.
    However, this behavior can lead to issues where Squish stops, does not create these processes,
    or causes these processes to not behave as expected.

    Remember, that these processes can also be external programs or services, which in our case
    are:
    \list
     \li D-Bus process
     \li RemoteSettingsServer
    \endlist

    Consequently, for Neptune 3 UI you have to force Squish to ignore these processes to run the
    tests. Otherwise these tests might not succeed from the beginning - for example because of a
    stopped D-Bus session.

    To \l{https://doc.froglogic.com/squish/latest/rg-ini-files.html#ignoredauts.txt}{ignore these processes}
    you have to add or edit the \c ignoredauts.txt file in your Squish installation directory.
    For macOS and other Unix-like Operating Systems, the file is in \c{SQUISHDIR/etc/}.

    For Linux, make the following change:

    \badcode
    # ignore the following processes
    RemoteSettingsServer
    dbus-daemon
    \endcode

    For other Operating Systems, you might need to modify the D-Bus process name.

    \note It might be a good idea to ignore all sub-processes created that are not relevant
    to test in the test suite.


    \section2 Additional Libraries

    Squish needs additional Qt libraries to run Neptune 3 UI tests. One solution is to copy the
    following libraries from your installation folder to Squish's installation library
    folder \c{SQUISHDIR/etc/lib}:

    \list
     \li \c libQt5Widgets.so
     \li \c libQt5QuickWidgets.so
    \endlist

    \note Different Qt versions: If the Qt version for your Squish release differs from the
    Qt version used in Neptune 3 UI, when the tests start, you may notice a warning in the
    logs from \c squishserver indicating: \br"\c{Loaded Qt version X.xx differs from Squish/Qt
    expected version X.yy, automating this AUT may not work.}"\br Currently, with Neptune 3 UI's
    5.12 and Squish's 5.11 there haven't been issues and tests can run using the additional
    libraries; but this warning mustn't be ignored.


    \section1 Run Squish from the Command Line or on a Target

    Once you have set up your test environment, you have the option to run tests via the
    Squish IDE, the command line, or as a service: such as a \c systemd service (recommended),
    for your target \l{Yocto} environment.

    Remember to use a D-Bus session beforehand, as this is how Neptune 3 UI communicates
    with its sub-processes.

    Normally, for simple cases you can use a server, \c squishserver, to run the tests and a
    corresponding client, \c squishrunner, that can request the server to run these tests
    and return their results.

    The AUT is on the server side, the test cases are transmitted from \c squishrunner to
    \c squishserver; they need not be stored on the test machine. If you use the Squish IDE, when
    performing tests, both \c squishserver and \c squishrunner are run seamlessly on the same
    machine.

    When you use the the command line, start the server first before the clients.

    Ensure that all IP addresses for \c squishrunner are able to connect to \c squishserver. On
    \c squishserver, this is stored in \c $SQUISH_DIR/etc/squishserverrc. Make sure that the
    IP ranges match, \e{localhost} is always valid.

    The server starts with the following:
    \badcode
$SQUISH_DIR/bin/squishserver --port 3333
    \endcode

    \note \c squishserver has a default port: 4322

    Change the directory to the \c squishtest path in your Neptune 3 UI installation, and run a
    single test case with the following command:

    \badcode
$SQUISH_DIR/bin/squishrunner --host SQUISH_SERVER_IP --port 3333 --testsuite suite_neptune3 --testcase tst_popup_climate
    \endcode

    The test cases are run on a client, and the results are returned.


    \section1 Squish on Target Environment (Yocto)

    You can add a test environment on target hardware with Neptune 3 UI installed. As mentioned
    before, for a Yocto environment, you need to create a custom \c squishserver using the Yocto
    SDK. A squish-embedded source package can be downloaded from the \l{Froglogic} website.
    Additionally, you need to have a binary desktop Squish installation to use the \c squishidl
    command.

    \section2 Create a Custom (Yocto) Squishserver

    The Yocto environment is an x64 Linux but unlike a standard Ubuntu x64 version,
    libraries in Yocto are stored in \c /lib64 versus \c /lib .

    Download and install the Yocto SDK separately, or use it from your Qt Automotive Suite
    installation (Qt Automotive Suite, Intel NUC).

    Next, download the squish-embedded source package \c squish-x.x.x-qt-embedded-src.tar.gz from
    the \l{Froglogic} website.

    To enable cross compiling, run the following command:
    \badcode
source <SDK-install-location>/environment-setup-corei7-64-poky-linux
    \endcode

    Then, change the directory to where the squish-embedded source package is located. Typically,
    the binary desktop edition is installed in \c SQUISH_DIR:

    \badcode
mkdir -p yocto/build && cd yocto/build
    \endcode

    Run the next two commands consecutively:

    \badcode
../../configure --with-qmake=<SDK-install-location>/sysroots/x86_64-pokysdk-linux/usr/bin/qmake --enable-qmake-config --with-squishidl=$SQUISH_DIR/bin/squishidl --disable-all --enable-qt --enable-server
    \endcode

    \badcode
./build
    \endcode

    Next, create a destination directory:

    \badcode
mkdir ../install
    \endcode

    Build and install Yocto into it. Then, create an archive for transferability and storability.
    Make sure to use the same version as Squish.

    \badcode
./build install DESTDIR=../install && tar cfz ../squish-x.x.x-qt-yocto.tgz ../install
    \endcode


    \section2 Install and Set Up Custom Yocto Squishserver on Target Hardware

    The affected directory structure on the Neptune 3 target is:
    \badcode
./home/root
./home/.squish
./opt
./opt/squish
    \endcode

    Perform the following steps on the target:

    \list
      \li Unpack the \c squish.x.x.x-qt.yocto.tgz into \c /opt/squish-for-qt-x.x.x and rename the
          directory according to the version number, if needed.
      \li For convenience, create a symlink from the directory you just created to \c{/opt/squish}.
          Consider this symlink as your \c{$SQUISH_DIR}.
      \li Edit \c $SQUISH_DIR/etc/squishserverrc according to your network arrangement.
      \li Edit \c $SQUISH_DIR/etc/ignoredauts.txt to exclude disruptive sub-processes.
      \li Place your license key in the \c{/home/root} directory.
      \li Transfer the \c $USER\.squish configuration files from your working Squish installation
          directory on your local machine. This directory is created when you first start the
          Squish IDE.
      \li Then, adapt the paths to the Neptune 3 UI installation: \c /opt/.
          The files involved are: \c server.ini and \c paths.ini in the \c .squish/ver1/
          sub-folder. For more information, see
          \l{https://doc.froglogic.com/squish/latest/rg-ini-files.html}{Squish initialization files}.
    \endlist
    \note Tests cannot be performed while Neptune 3 UI is running. You need to make
    sure that the \c neptune3-ui process is terminated, prior to running the tests.
