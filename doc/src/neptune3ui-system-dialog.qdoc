   \title Neptune 3 UI - System Dialog

   Neptune 3 UI has a system dialog where the user can see and monitor the performance
   of the system while running Neptune 3 UI. In order to pop the dialog up, user can
   tap on the Qt logo that is located at the bottom right corner of the UI.

   \section1 System Monitor

   The first tab of the system dialog contains the following information:

   \list
   \li Startup Timings: provides the time spent from booting until the process starting
       point of the System UI and from the starting point of the System UI until the first
       frame to be drawn
   \li CPU consumptions and memory consumptions (CPU, GPU and Memory consumption values
   should be taken as absolute values, because visualization of these values takes performance
   resources as well)
   \li Network (Internet Connection) Status
   \li Connected Network Devices with all their address information
   \li Version: shows which Neptune 3 UI, Application Manager and Qt Interface Framework versions are being
       used
   \li Platform: shows which operating system, Qt version, and OpenGL are being used.
   \endlist

   On top of the list, there is also a switch button that is used to show the system monitor
   overlay on top of the UI to show the performance monitor numbers while operating the UI.

   \section1 List of Apps

   The second tab of the system dialog shows a list of all apps installed in Neptune 3 UI
   and their states. When an app is running, the corresponding section contains the following
   information:

   \list
   \li Whether \c Autostart and \c Autorecover options are enabled
   \li Current CPU and Memory consumptions
   \li Window(s), in which the app is shown
   \li Time spent until the app's first frame is drawn
   \endlist

   Each app item also has a switch button to enable the performance information overlay on top of
   the app window. For an app that has two windows, \l{ApplicationCCWindow} and
   \l{ApplicationICWindow}, two switch buttons can be seen and selected depending on the need.

   Tap the X icon on the right of the app, to terminate the app. Once the app is terminated, only
   the app's name and the start button remain in the app's section. Tap the â–· button to start the
   application again.

   \note Only removing the app widget from the home screen, does not terminate the app, it may
   still be running in the background.

   The \c Autostart switch button enables apps to run automatically on Neptune 3 UI, upon startup.

   The \c Autorecover switch button enables apps to recover after crashing or being forced to close;
   they are restarted automatically. After three unsuccessful recovery attempts \c Autostart option
   is switched off.

   \warning It's possible to disable \c Autostart option for all the apps, including system apps,
    like Instrument Cluster, HUD, and Climate. If \c Autostart is disabled, these apps won't
    start when Neptune 3 UI restarts. For the Instrument Cluster and HUD, this leads to empty
    windows on system start-up; the Climate app won't be shown in the Center Console. For apps with
    widgets, if the app is stopped or the widget is closed, and \c Autostart is disabled, then the
    app doesn't start and the widget isn't shown on the Home screen upon system restart.

   You can remove the app if it is not built-in (installed with
   \l{Qt Creator Plugin for Qt Application Manager}, \l{Controller}{appman-controller} or from
   \l{Neptune 3 UI Apps}{Downloads app}). To remove the installed app, tap on the recyle bin icon
    near the app id.

   \section1 Performance Tab

   The third tab of the system dialog contains two switch buttons to enable the performance
   overlay of the \l{center console display} and the \l{instrument cluster}. It forces the System UI
   to constantly re-draw itself to get the current GPU/CPU consumptions.

   \section1 Diagnostics Tab

   The last tab of the system dialog shows the output of the qtdiag diagnostic tool.
